## About
This is an example of a simple static furniture website. The design of the site was referenced from <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/18975537-Furniture-Ecommerce-Website?utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=gapsystudio&utm_content=Furniture%20Ecommerce%20Website&utm_medium=Social_Share&utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=gapsystudio&utm_content=Furniture%20Ecommerce%20Website&utm_medium=Social_Share">Furniture Ecommerce Website</a> on <a href="https://dribbble.com">Dribbble</a>. There's also an animation on page load.

## Tools
I've used HTML5, SCSS, and plain JS to create the structure for the site. The animation is done using the <a href="https://greensock.com/gsap/">GSAP by Greensock</a> animation library and is applied using a CDN. I've also used <a href="https://parceljs.org">Parcel JS</a> to minify the project files and uploaded it to <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com/">CloudFlare Pages</a>

## Things I've learned

- Handling animation in JS
- Use of pseudo selectors like `::before` and `::after`
- Use of `position` property to change the positioning of HTML elements.

## Things I want to continue learning

- Events in JS, load events, DOM events etc.
- Rendering list items into DOM from JS
- More about `GSAP` library
- Responsive design in CSS
- Static site generators like `Gatsby`, `Eleventy`.

## My experience

I was fun going back to the basics, creating this static site in HTML. I started this project because I was having a burn out of React, so it seemed like a good idea to get a fresh start on things. I'll probably continue building more static sites, and playing with plain JS. I also want to try two static site generators, Gatsby and Eleventy for the next static sites.

All said, now I'm ready to take a good one day break from coding.

P.S. I'm pretty sure I'll go back to coding after just 2 hours of pushing this change and end up not taking a break.
